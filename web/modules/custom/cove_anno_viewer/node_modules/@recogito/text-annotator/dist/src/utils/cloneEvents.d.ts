/**
 * Events need to be manually mapped into new objects:
 * 1. It preserves the `target` and `currentTarget` properties.
 *    Otherwise, they will be `null` when the event is read beyond the handler.
 * 2. Spread operator can copy only own enumerable properties, not inherited ones.
 *    Therefore, we need to manually copy the props we're interested in.
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget
